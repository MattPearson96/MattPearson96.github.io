<h1>You travel upstream</h1>
<img src="port.jpg" alt="A busy port">
<p>After walking upstream a short way you seem to find yourself already arriving at a large river-side port. Soon you realize the noise you hear is not coming from a busy port, but rather a hospital room where you can vaugly hear a doctor talking to what you think might be your wife. This is when you realize your situation is not real, and you are actually deep in a months long coma.</p>
