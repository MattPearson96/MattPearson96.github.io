<img src="windmills.jpg" alt="are you dreaming?">
<p>You find yourself in a stange place that feels different. You are neither comfortable nor uneasy. This is where you realize you have not seen your family in what seems like days, and then it hits you. This is not real, none of it is real. You have been lost in a coma for months.</p>
